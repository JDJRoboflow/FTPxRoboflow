# RoboflowxFTP
# 🚀 Roboflow X FTP Integration Overview

## Project Purpose

This project aims to demonstrate how Roboflow can seamlessly integrate with an FTP server to enable automated data collection, classification, and model training. It focuses on bridging traditional factory camera systems (such as the Keyence IV3) with modern machine learning workflows.

By configuring an FTP server to receive inspection images from a Keyence IV3 camera, and building a Roboflow pipeline to pull, organize, and utilize these images, we lay the foundation for a highly scalable, automated computer vision system.

## Why Roboflow + FTP?

- 🔗 **Flexible Data Ingestion:** FTP acts as a universal drop-off point for images from legacy camera systems.
- 📊 **Organized Image Collection:** Roboflow can automatically retrieve and structure incoming images for training datasets.
- 🏋️ **Continuous Improvement:** As more images flow in, models can be retrained, improving over time without major system redesigns.
- 🌐 **Scalable Deployment:** This setup can work across multiple cameras, stations, and manufacturing lines with minimal adjustments.

## High-Level Workflow

1. 📷 **Image Capture:** Keyence IV3 camera captures inspection images.
2. 📥 **Image Transfer:** Images are automatically pushed to the Jetson's FTP server.
3. 🔀 **Image Retrieval:** Roboflow scripts monitor the FTP upload directory.
4. 📈 **Data Utilization:** Images are imported into Roboflow for annotation, classification, and model training.
5. 📊 **Model Deployment:** Updated models can be pushed to edge devices for real-time inference.

## Future Possibilities

- SFTP integration for enhanced security.
- Real-time event triggers for immediate model retraining or quality control.
- Custom Roboflow workflows to automate defect detection, classification, and trend analysis.
- Dashboards for monitoring FTP ingestion rates and Roboflow model performance.
